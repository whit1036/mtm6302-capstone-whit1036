# Capstone Project - Part 2
## Design Decisions:
- I designed this app to be simplistic, intuitive, and easy to use for any user on Desktop, and Mobile sizes (tablet mockup design will be the same as desktop).
- For the font style, I used Google Fonts to find a cool space-themed font, to correlate with the astrology based theme of the app. I opted for a font size that is easy to read for both the desktop, and mobile mockups.
