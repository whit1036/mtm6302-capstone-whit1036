# Capstone Project - Part 3
## Prototype Challenges:
During the creation of this prototype, I ran into various roadblocks and challenges while coding. One of the main challenges I faced was trying fit all of the content for each section in a viewport height of 100vh for all device sizes, while maintaining responsiveness and not having the content extend past the viewport height. To fix this issue, I had to set the height of some elements such as the background and borders to be 100% width instead to fit all of the content. Although this worked, I'm still not completely satisfied with the result, and would like to improve upon it if given the chance.

Another issue I ran into was making the content look exactly like the mockup, with adjusting various elements widths. For most of the elements, I used Bootstrap containers, however, they were appearing too large on the desktop and did not match the look of my mockup. To solve this challenge, I had to use media queries to target certain elements to adjust the width to make it look similar to the mockup I created, while trying to maintain responsiveness.

Coding a perfect version of the mockup was very tricky for me to complete. Although my code design features elememts looks almost like it, there are certain sections that I had trouble making look like my mockup for all sizes of screen. Specifically, the generated content section, and the favoutites section were difficult for me to replicate. The generated content section looks good on mobile, but does not take up the viewport of the screen on desktop. After many attepmts to fix this issue, I decided to leave it the way it was re-designed. In my mockup, the buttons and headers appear in different areas on the desktop version of the favourites section. After some attempts to create this change with media quries, I could not get the result that the mockup illustrates so I decided to have the favourites section buttons and headers appear in the same fashion on desktop.

Re-creating the high-quality image preview that displays to the users when they click on the generated image was a challenge to re-create. I used Bootstraps modal to create this result, however, it does not look like the one created in my mockup. I tried using various resources to overcome this issue, but the final result still works well with the user workflow to complete the task to achieve the result.

In conclusion, I think that if time permitted, I could come back at fix some of the viewport heights, container widths, and various other elements to create a nearly identical prototype. I belive this design can still perform well for the final version when I add the JS, and it contains all of the content needed for the user to get their desired results, and experience with the application. All in all, I enjoyed the design process, and if I have time I can attempt to improve upon the various unresolved changes.
