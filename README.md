# Capstone Project - Part 2
## Design Decisions:
- I designed this app to be simplistic, intuitive, and easy to use for any user on Desktop, and Mobile sizes (tablet mockup design will be the same as desktop).
- For the font style, I used Google Fonts to find a cool space-themed font, to correlate with the astrology based theme of the app. I opted for a font size that is easy to read for both the desktop, and mobile mockups.
- I wanted the user to have an “outer-world” experience when using this app, so I opted for a neon green/space white colour pallet which is eye-popping, bold, and space-like. This will really shine in the final version.
-The buttons I designed speak for themselves, and gives the user an easy way to navigate around the app. I’ve featured home buttons, directional arrows, hearts (for liking an image on the image generator page), and a garbage can (for deleting images on the favourites page).
- In conclusion, my objective for this project is to create the best, and most ideal app for the best user experience, and user flow. I want to give the user a fun experience, so they save as many images as they encounter on a regular basis, and always return to look back at the cool pictures they’re derived!
