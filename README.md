# Capstone Project - Part 4
## First Steps:
To begin the Capstone Part 4 - Astrology Picture of the Day Search assignment, I signed up for my own personal NASA APOD API. In doing so, it will allow me to use the Fetch API for asynchronous operations, without the need for other object methods. Once I signed up, I received my personal API Key which I can use to begin to test using the Fetch API. To wrap my head around beginning this phase of the project, I did some research on how to use an asynchronous operation with the NASA API. I came across a video that demonstrated how to use the NASA API to create, and test the API using JavaScript, which I have referenced in my list below.
## Programming Challenges:
